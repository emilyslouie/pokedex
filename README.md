## Pokédex Explorer

Ever since I was young, I have always loved Pokémon, hence the Piplup profile picture. To practice my React skills, I developed a Pokédex application that displays Pokémon from the first generation to the fifth generation.

You can see the live project [here](https://pokedexexplorer.netlify.app).

## Stack
- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- Utilized the [Pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co)

Clone the repo and then cd to the folder of the project. 
Then type:

### `npm start`
