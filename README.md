## Pokédex Explorer

Ever since I was young, I have always loved Pokémon. To practice my React skills, I developed a Pokédex application that displays Pokémon from the first generation to the seventh generation. This is complete with a full landing page that summarizes the project, a tab to browse the full catalouge by generation, and a search tab that filters for user-specified Pokémon by name or ID. Completed in 5 days.

You can see the live project [here](https://pokedexexplorer.netlify.app).

## Stack
- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- Utilized the [Pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co) for the Pokémon and their details, getting all the Pokémon up until generation 7
- Used [Material UI] (https://material-ui.com) for the search bar, and [react-scroll-to-top] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scroll-to-top)

## How to run the project

Clone the repo and then cd to the folder of the project. 
Then type:
